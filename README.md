This GitHub repository provides a collection of sentiment analysis datasets, including IMDB movie reviews and Twitter data. The IMDB dataset consists of labeled movie reviews commonly used for binary sentiment classification, while the Twitter dataset contains tweets annotated with sentiment labels such as positive and negative, making it suitable for analyzing public opinion on social media. In addition to the original datasets, the repository also includes two augmented versions: an 80% augmented IMDB dataset and an 80% augmented Twitter dataset. These augmented datasets were generated using natural language processing techniques to increase sample diversity and improve model generalization. Together, these four datasets offer a comprehensive resource for developing and evaluating sentiment analysis models.
